9837,1038558938139189248,Sat Sep 08 18:45:21 +0000 2018,@ Naomi_Osaka_ Well done. You deserved to win. Don’t be upset. The crowd naturally wanted Serena to win although God knows why. Try to enjoy what you have achieved despite all this other rubbish.,
9838,1038558938000773120,Sat Sep 08 18:45:20 +0000 2018,Honestly how dare you treat Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams like this,

9840,1038558930664914944,Sat Sep 08 18:45:19 +0000 2018,Sarena likes to hog the attention. She can’t stand losing. She cheats and when Umpire calls her out she attacks him threatens his job. What a bully.,
9841,1038558928836149254,Sat Sep 08 18:45:18 +0000 2018,I disagree. She ruined the moment by being an immature baby. Basically went full McEnroe. Osaka got robbed of HER moment by an unstable and irrational Serena. Worst moment of Serena's career.,
9842,1038558928517251072,Sat Sep 08 18:45:18 +0000 2018,"It's one thing for her to be outplayed by Osaka, and I'm the biggest Serena fan saying this. But I've seen Connors, McEnroe say a lot worse to chair umpires and they weren't done this way. Serena played lousy, Osaka played well and the umpire was a snowflake/jerk too. ALL 3 true.",

# Naomi Osaka & Serena Williams
## Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

### Background

## Goal
* build my own corpus
* use sentiment analysis on Twitter data
* create reproducible research (i.e. a notebook leading others through this project)

### Data Collection
took a long time to scrape tweets
I thought I'd be able to get them all within a couple of minutes, but it was taking a long time
While I was waiting I realized that a lot of tweets might overlap, as they referenced both women
so I was going to have separate databases for naomi osaka and serena williams, but I don't know if that's going to be possible
so I might just have to do an English tweets database and a Japanese tweets database

okay, I just checked and it took me about 20 minutes to collect 8000 tweets, and they all lasted about the span of an hour
I don't think I really considered just how much data there was going to be
this was a worldwide event, people from across the globe were watching and tweeting about this
so I'll need to be a bit more specific with my time intervals

don't know how to do that, so... I think I'll just leave it running all night?...
or maybe I'll leave it running whi

ok, I've simply implemented a counter in the code to control the max number of tweets that I get
I'll do the actual collection later
looks like the best bet will be to 1) get naomi osaka tweets 2) get serena williams tweets 3) join duplicates 4) remove repeats 5) remove non-english tweets 6) remove links to news articles tc 7) remove tweets less than a certain number of characters

### Data Pre-Processing
I'm going to focus on a small English corpus for now. Other Twitter projects I've looked at have analyzed millions of tweets, and I've only got 30k. So I'll consider this to be a pilot analysis.
I'm going to join the English tweet tables on their tweet IDs.
